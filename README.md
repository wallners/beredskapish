# Rules
The game of Beredskapish explores the idea of taking an exact number of tricks specified by a bid before the hand.

## Number of players
The game is played with three players. Every non-human player becomes a bot.

## Deck
The game is played using a standard 52-card deck, with ace (A) being the highest rank, two (2) the lowest.

## Deal
After the dealing is complete, the next card is turned face up, and the suit of this card determines the trump suit for the deal.
        When every player has made a bid, the player to the left of the dealer makes the opening lead.
        Play then proceeds as usual in a trick-taking game, with each player in turn playing one card.
        Players must follow suit, unless they have no cards of the led suit, in which case they may play any card.
        The highest card of the led suit wins the trick unless ruffed, when the highest trump card wins.
        The first hand is played with one card dealt to each player. On each succeeding deal one more card is dealt out to each player,
      	until there are a total of 5 cards per hand.

## Points
A player who makes the exact number of tricks bid scores the amount bid. Over- and undertricking scores zero points.
